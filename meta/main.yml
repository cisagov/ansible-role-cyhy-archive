  # With the release of version 2.10, Ansible finally correctly
  # identifies Kali Linux as being the Kali distribution of the Debian
  # OS family.  This simplifies a lot of things for roles that support
  # Kali Linux, so it makes sense to force the installation of Ansible
  # 2.10 or newer.

  platforms:
    # The cyhy-archive command from cyhy-core is still Python 2 and with
    # distributions ending support for Python 2 we can only support a limited
    # number of platforms.
