[![CodeQL](https://github.com/cisagov/ansible-role-cyhy-archive/workflows/CodeQL/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cisagov/ansible-role-cyhy-archive/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml)

An Ansible role for installing the `cyhy_archive.sh` script from
[cisagov/cyhy-core](https://github.com/cisagov/cyhy-core).

## Pre-requisites ##

In order to execute the Molecule tests for this Ansible role in GitHub
Actions, a build user must exist in AWS. The accompanying Terraform
code will create the user with the appropriate name and
permissions. This only needs to be run once per project, per AWS
account. This user can also be used to run the Molecule tests on your
local machine.

Before the build user can be created, you will need a profile in your
AWS credentials file that allows you to read and write your remote
Terraform state.  (You almost certainly do not want to use local
Terraform state for this long-lived build user.)  If the build user is
to be created in the CISA COOL environment, for example, then you will
need the `cool-terraform-backend` profile.

The easiest way to set up the Terraform remote state profile is to
make use of our
[`aws-profile-sync`](https://github.com/cisagov/aws-profile-sync)
utility. Follow the usage instructions in that repository before
continuing with the next steps, and note that you will need to know
where your team stores their remote profile data in order to use
[`aws-profile-sync`](https://github.com/cisagov/aws-profile-sync).

To create the build user, follow these instructions:

```console
cd terraform
terraform init --upgrade=true
terraform apply
```
